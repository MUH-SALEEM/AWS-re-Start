Jenkins
What does the tool do?

Jenkins is an open-source automation server that is used to build, test, and deploy software applications. It provides a platform for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) processes, enabling developers to automate the building, testing, and deployment of their software applications.

Why is that an important need?

Jenkins is one of the top DevOps tools because it is free, open-source and modular, and can integrate with pretty much every other DevOps tool out there. There are over a thousand plugins that you can use to extend Jenkinsâ€™ capabilities and make it more user-specific. All of these plugins and extensions are developed in Java. This means that Jenkins can also be installed on any operating system that runs on Java
