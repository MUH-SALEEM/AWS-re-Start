<h2>Jenkins</h2>
<p><strong>What does the tool do?</strong><br>
Jenkins is an open-source automation server that is used to build, test, and deploy software applications. It provides a platform for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) processes, enabling developers to automate the building, testing, and deployment of their software applications.</p>

<p><strong>Why is that an important need?</strong><br>
Jenkins is one of the top DevOps tools because it is free, open-source and modular, and can integrate with pretty much every other DevOps tool out there. There are over a thousand plugins that you can use to extend Jenkinsâ€™ capabilities and make it more user-specific. All of these plugins and extensions are developed in Java. This means that Jenkins can also be installed on any operating system that runs on Java</p>

<p><strong>Identify specific use cases for the tool.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Easy Installation: Jenkins is a platform-agnostic, self-contained Java-based program, ready to run with packages for Windows, Mac OS, and Unix-like operating systems.</li>
<li>Easy Configuration: Jenkins is easily set up and configured using its web interface, featuring error checks and a built-in help function.</li>
<li>Available Plugins: There are hundreds of plugins available in the Update Center, integrating with every tool in the CI and CD toolchain.</li>
<li>Extensible: Jenkins can be extended by means of its plugin architecture, providing nearly endless possibilities for what it can do.</li>
<li>Easy Distribution: Jenkins can easily distribute work across multiple machines for faster builds, tests, and deployments across multiple platforms.</li>
<li>Free Open Source: Jenkins is an open-source resource backed by heavy community support.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Jenkins Architecture</h2>
    <p>Jenkins has a master-slave architecture, where the master node is responsible for the overall management of jobs and the distribution of work to the slave nodes. The slave nodes, also known as build agents or worker nodes, are responsible for executing the jobs assigned by the master node.</p>
    <p>The master node is where the Jenkins web interface is located, and it manages all the plugins, configurations, and jobs. It schedules the jobs, assigns them to the available slave nodes, and monitors the progress of the builds.</p>
    <p>The slave nodes are the machines where the actual builds take place.</p>
