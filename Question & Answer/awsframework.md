# AWS Well-Architected Framework fact finding 

## Questions

**1)  What are the five pillars of the Well Architected Framework (WAF)?**

The five pillars of AWS Well-Architected Framework are as follows:
* Operational Excellence
* Security
* Reliability
* Performance Efficiency
* Cost Optimization


**2)  What are the 3 areas of operational excellence in the cloud?**

The Operational Excellence pillar includes the ability to support development and run workloads effectively, gain insight into their operations, and to continuously improve supporting processes and procedures to deliver business value.

**3)  What are the design principles that strengthen system security?**

* Implement a strong identity foundation.
* Enable traceability.
* Apply security at all layers.
* Automate security best practices.
* Protect data in transit and at rest.
* Keep people away from data.
* Prepare for security events.


**4)  What are the design principles that increase reliability?**

The design principles that increase the reliability in the AWS Framework are:

* To automatically recover from failure
* Test recovery procedures
* Scaling horizontally to increase aggregating workload availability.
* Stop guessing capacity.Managing change in automation.
* The reliability pillar provides an overview of design principles, best practices, and questions.


**5)  What are the areas to focus on to achieve performance efficiency in the cloud?**

There are four best practice areas that help achieve performance efficiency in the cloud and these are as follows:

* Selection- Using a data-driven approach to select the patterns and implementation for your architecture and achieve a cost effective solution.
* Review- Cloud technologies are rapidly evolving and you must ensure that workload components are using the latest technologies and approaches to continually improve performance.
* Monitoring- After you implement your workload, you must monitor its performance so that you can remediate any issues before they impact your customers. 
* Monitoring metrics should be used to raise alarms when thresholds are breached.Tradeoffs- When you architect solutions, think about tradeoffs to ensure an optimal approach. 
* Depending on your situation, you could trade consistency, durability, and space for time or latency, to deliver higher performance.


**6)  What are the different approaches to using AWS resources in a cost-effective manner?**

Different approaches to use AWS resources in an effective way are by modifying the demand, using a throttle, buffer, or queue to smooth the demand and serve it with less resources resulting in a lower cost, or process it later with a batch service. 

In AWS, you can automatically provision resources to match the workload demand.
