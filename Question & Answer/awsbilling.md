			<p>Explain the AWS Simple Monthly Calculator.</p>
			<p>The AWS Simple Monthly Calculator is a tool that allows you to estimate your monthly AWS usage costs based on your expected usage of various AWS services. It is a free web-based tool that can help you to plan and budget your AWS infrastructure costs before you start using AWS services.</p>
			<p>The AWS Simple Monthly Calculator allows you to estimate the costs of different AWS services based on various usage scenarios.</p>
			<p>You can enter details such as the number of instances, the type of instances, the storage required, data transfer requirements, and other factors that affect the cost of using AWS services.</p>
			<p>The AWS Simple Monthly Calculator provides an estimated cost for each service that you use, as well as a breakdown of the costs for each component of the service. You can use this information to optimize your usage of AWS services and reduce your infrastructure costs.</p>

			<p>List and explain the different EC2 pricing models.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>On-Demand Instances: This pricing model allows you to pay for your EC2 instances on an hourly basis, with no long-term commitments or upfront costs. You only pay for the hours that you use the instances. This pricing model is suitable for short-term, unpredictable workloads, or for applications that require the flexibility to scale up and down quickly.</li>
				<li>Reserved Instances: This pricing model allows you to reserve capacity on the EC2 platform for a specified period of time, up to 3 years. By committing to use the capacity for a longer period, you can get a discount on the hourly rate compared to On-Demand Instances. Reserved Instances are suitable for applications with predictable workloads, or for those that require capacity for a longer period.</li>
				<li>Spot Instances: This pricing model allows you to bid on unused EC2 capacity, and if your bid is accepted, you can use the capacity at a much lower hourly rate than On-Demand Instances. However, the capacity is not guaranteed, and if the spot price goes above your bid, your instances will be terminated. Spot Instances are suitable for applications with flexible start and end times, or for workloads that can be interrupted or stopped without any negative impact.</li>
